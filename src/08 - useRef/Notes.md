# useRef

- [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#is-there-something-like-instance-variables):
  > Conceptually, you can think of refs as similar to instance variables in a class. Unless you’re doing lazy initialization, avoid setting refs during rendering — this can lead to surprising behavior. Instead, typically you want to modify refs in event handlers and effects.
